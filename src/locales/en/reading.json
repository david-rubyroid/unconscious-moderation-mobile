        "description": "Which is better, pleasure or happiness? Most of us think they're the same thing, but they're not even close. One disappears the moment you experience it. The other builds something lasting inside you. Understanding this shift changes everything about how you see alcohol and what you're really seeking when you reach for a drink.\n\nWelcome to your 90-day journey of conscious choice. This isn't about restriction or rules. It's about creating space to rediscover what you're truly looking for and whether alcohol is actually getting you there."

        "title": "What Pleasure Really Is",
        "description": "Picture this: you're scrolling through your phone, one quick hit after another. Buy this, click that, swipe here, and you'll feel amazing. Our unconscious minds get flooded with messages that pleasure equals happiness.\n\nEach of these quick hits triggers dopamine, your brain's \"want more\" chemical. Dopamine is all about anticipation and seeking. It's what makes you excited about getting something, but the moment you have it, dopamine drops and you're left wanting the next thing. Think of it as your brain's motivation system, always pushing you toward the next reward.\n\nThis is different from serotonin, your \"contentment and wellbeing\" chemical. Serotonin creates that deep sense of satisfaction, emotional stability, and genuine happiness that can last for hours or even days. It's what makes you feel truly good about yourself and your life, not just excited about what's coming next.\n\nHere's what makes alcohol so tricky: it floods your brain with both chemicals artificially. You get the dopamine rush (excitement, energy) and a temporary boost of serotonin (feeling content and relaxed). But when the alcohol wears off, both chemicals crash, leaving you depleted and craving more. Over time, your brain produces less of these chemicals naturally because it's relying on alcohol to do the job."

        "description": "Happiness is different. It doesn't come from things you can consume or experiences you can buy. It builds itself quietly through connections, growth, and alignment with who you truly are.\n\nThink about the last time you felt genuinely proud of something you accomplished. Not the quick high of checking something off your list, but that deeper satisfaction of working toward something meaningful. Or remember a conversation that left you feeling truly understood. That warm feeling that stayed with you for days.\n\nWhat if happiness isn't something you chase, but something you uncover? Research shows that lasting contentment grows from meaningful relationships, personal growth, and living according to your deepest values. It's less about feeling good in the moment and more about feeling aligned with yourself over time."

        "description": "Alcohol promises connection, relaxation, and fun. And it delivers, at least temporarily. There's nothing wrong with enjoying a drink to celebrate or unwind. But what happens when we unconsciously turn to alcohol seeking happiness instead of just enjoying the moment?\n\nThe buzz from alcohol fades quickly, often leaving us feeling less than before. You know that feeling when you wake up after drinking, that heavy weight in your chest that isn't just a hangover? That's guilt mixed with regret, your body's way of telling you something feels off. When we repeatedly reach for a drink to fill an emotional need, we might be trading away the very things that create lasting fulfillment: our energy, our genuine connections, and our trust in ourselves.\n\nWhat would shift if you could distinguish between what your body actually wants and what has become automatic?"

        "description": "These 90 days give you space to step back and notice the difference between what feels good temporarily and what actually nourishes your life. You'll have time to reconnect with the things that create real contentment instead of just quick relief.\n\nThis isn't about perfection or deprivation. It's about curiosity and self-awareness. It's about discovering what you're truly seeking when you reach for a drink, and exploring whether there might be other ways to meet that need.\n\nWe'll guide you with tools rooted in neuroscience and psychology, but the most transformative tool is hypnotherapy. Your unconscious mind drives 95% of your behavior, while willpower only reaches the surface. Through guided hypnosis sessions, we help you access that deeper part of your mind where lasting change actually happens. In this relaxed state, your brain becomes naturally more open to rewiring old patterns and produces the same feel-good chemicals you've been seeking through alcohol.\n\nWe also use reflective journaling to help you connect with your unconscious mind from another angle. Writing down your thoughts and feelings gives form to what's hidden. Your unconscious speaks in feelings and symbols, not logic, and journaling helps translate those deeper messages into awareness you can act on.\n\nWhat would it feel like to approach these 90 days with curiosity rather than judgment? Pleasure isn't the enemy, life would be pretty dull without moments of pure joy. This is about finding balance and discovering what truly fills you up, beyond what any drink can offer.\n\nYou're not fixing yourself. You're remembering who you are beneath the habits."

But here's what your brain isn't telling you: that version of you is borrowed time. The more you reach for alcohol to unlock that feeling, the more elusive it becomes. What once took one drink now takes two, then three. You're chasing something that keeps moving further away.\n\nWhen you step away from drinking, your body has some catching up to do. Think of it like this: alcohol has been your brain's shortcut to feeling good, flooding it with dopamine and serotonin whenever you wanted. But shortcuts have consequences. Over time, your brain gets lazy, producing less and less of these natural feel-good chemicals on its own.\n\nNow, without that artificial boost, your brain is scrambling to remember how to create joy, calm, and confidence from within.

Your emotions might feel bigger, brighter, more intense than they have in years.\n\nThis isn't a flaw in your process. It's your nervous system waking up, remembering how to feel everything fully instead of through the muted filter of alcohol. Your brain is literally rewiring itself, building new pathways that don't require a chemical crutch.\n\nThe beautiful truth about your brain? It's designed to adapt. Neuroplasticity means every day you choose differently, you're strengthening new patterns and weakening old ones.

They build, crest, and then naturally subside, usually within 15 to 20 minutes. Your job isn't to make them disappear, it's to stay present while they pass through you.\n\nWhen the wave comes, notice it. \"There's that familiar pull.\" Feel where it lives in your body. Is it tension in your chest? A restless energy in your hands? Instead of running from the sensation, get curious about it. What is this feeling really asking for? Rest? Connection? A moment of peace?"

Your mind starts spinning stories: \"This is too hard,\" \"I don't have what it takes,\" \"One drink wouldn't hurt.\" Left unchecked, these thoughts can hijack your nervous system, triggering that ancient fight-or-flight response that makes everything feel urgent and dangerous.\n\nThe moment you notice your thoughts picking up speed, interrupt the pattern. It doesn't have to be dramatic. Touch something textured nearby. Take three deep breaths. Step outside for sixty seconds. Ask yourself, \"What do I actually need right now?\" If this resonates, there are more practices like this in the toolkit whenever you're ready.\n\nThen redirect that mental energy somewhere useful. Write three sentences about how you're feeling. Call someone who makes you laugh. Put on music and move your body. The goal isn't to feel better instantly, it's to remember you have choices beyond the old familiar one."

Isolation makes everything feel bigger and scarier. Reach out, even when it's the last thing you want to do.\n\nFind your ground. Step outside barefoot. Hold something warm. Engage your senses to remind your nervous system you're safe right here, right now.\n\nThe person you're becoming, the one who can feel deeply without numbing, who can choose from awareness instead of habit, that person is worth every wave you're learning to ride.

Your relationships shift subtly. These aren't accusations, just observations worth considering.\n\nHere's what it looks like from the inside: the creeping tolerance where one glass became three.

Sound familiar?\n\nWe've normalized rushing through life on autopilot. Wake up, check phone, work stress, traffic, deadlines, collapse into bed, repeat. We're so caught up in the constant motion that we barely notice we're living our days half-awake, going through the motions without really being present.\n\nAnd when that automatic living starts feeling heavy or overwhelming, alcohol becomes the easy button. It's right there, promising to hit pause on all that noise in your head.\n\nHere's the thing: your brain isn't trying to make your life difficult. It's just doing what it's always done, looking out for danger. Your mind automatically zooms in on what's wrong, what's stressful, what's not working. But what if you could flip the script?\n\nWhat if instead of your brain automatically hunting for problems, you could train it to notice what's actually going right in your life?

Each time you consciously appreciate something, you strengthen neural pathways associated with contentment and resilience. You're literally rewiring your brain to default toward wellbeing rather than worry.\n\nPeople who practice gratitude regularly show improved sleep, lower blood pressure, stronger immune systems, and significantly less engagement in addictive behaviors.

The sunset that painted your kitchen wall golden, even on the day you got difficult news. The friend who texted at exactly the right moment.

The taste of your morning coffee, the fact that you slept through the night, the way sunlight hits your wall. Write it all down.\n\n\"Morning anchor:\" Before you reach for your phone or check the news, pause and notice three things you're grateful for right now. Maybe it's the quality of light coming through your window, the softness of your sheets, or simply the fact that you woke up without a hangover. Let yourself actually feel the appreciation, not just think it.\n\n\"Evening reflection:\" As you're winding down, spend a few minutes writing about one moment from the day that felt good. It might be a conversation that made you laugh, a small accomplishment at work, or the way your pet looked at you. Notice how different it feels to end your day focusing on what went well rather than what went wrong.\n\n\"Craving companion:\" The next time you feel pulled toward a drink, pause and look around you. Find something in your immediate environment to appreciate. The way light reflects off a glass of water. The texture of a blanket. The sound of life happening outside your window. Let appreciation fill the space where the craving was living.\n\n\"Connection practice:\" Tell someone specifically why you're grateful for them. Not just \"thanks for everything,\" but \"I'm grateful for the way you listen without trying to fix things\" or \"I appreciate how you make me laugh even when I'm having a rough day.\" Notice how this kind of expression creates a connection that no drink ever could."

You're allowed to appreciate your courage in making this change while also acknowledging how difficult it is. You're allowed to celebrate small victories while still having larger goals.\n\nIn fact, feeling good about yourself and your life makes change easier, not harder.

When something slips and they don't meet these impossible standards, the feeling of complete failure hits hard.\n\nFor men, shame often comes from different expectations. Society says they should be strong, in control, never showing weakness. So when vulnerability appears or control slips, shame hits because it feels like failing at being \"man enough.\"\n\nThese are just social ideas we've been taught, not actual truths about who you should be. The more we challenge these old expectations, the more freedom we create to be ourselves."

Let guilt guide you toward positive actions, making amends, seeking help, or changing behavior. When you address the actions that create guilt, like drinking too much, you empower yourself to make different choices.\n\nFor shame, the most powerful tools are empathy and self-compassion. Shame thrives in secrecy, silence, and judgment. But when you share your struggles with someone who understands without judging, shame starts to lose its power.

When someone offers you a drink, when you're stressed after a long day, when happy hour sounds tempting, you can pause.

Alcohol artificially boosts GABA while suppressing glutamate. When you remove alcohol, your brain temporarily overproduces glutamate, making you feel anxious, shaky, or overstimulated.\n\nYou might also notice increased social anxiety and FOMO (fear of missing out). Without alcohol as your social lubricant, gatherings might feel more intense or overwhelming. You might scroll through social media seeing friends at happy hours and feel that familiar tug of \"I should be there.\" This is completely normal.

What do you actually do when that craving hits and feels so intense you're not sure how to get through it?\n\nPicture yourself yesterday evening. Maybe you felt that familiar pull toward a drink, that wave of wanting that seemed to build from nowhere. Did you notice how it felt in your body? How your mind started telling you stories about why \"just one\" would be okay?\n\nThere's a technique for navigating these intense moments, and it's called urge surfing. Think of it as learning to ride out those waves of cravings like a pro surfer. No board required."

But sometimes they can really interrupt your ability to enjoy your day.\n\nYou may have noticed that cravings behave a lot like ocean waves. They start small, build up intensity, reach a peak, and then gradually fade away. With urge surfing, you learn to let these feelings rise and fall naturally without letting them knock you off your feet."

        "title": "Your Brain on Cravings (Quick Refresher)",
        "description": "Whether it's alcohol, sugar, or any other habit, your brain is wired to crave things that make you feel good. Remember dopamine, that \"feel good\" chemical we talked about? When you're craving a drink, your brain is essentially looking for that dopamine boost that brings those short-lived feelings of pleasure.\n\nHere's what's fascinating: the more you deny yourself something you crave, the stronger your desire can feel initially. But here's the key, if you don't feed that craving, it actually loses power over time. The longer you go without giving in, the weaker these urges become.\n\nPut simply: in the moment, these urges can feel overwhelming. But in reality, they're temporary visitors. If you can ride them out without giving in, they get weaker and less frequent."

        "description": "Urge surfing is a mindfulness technique that's all about paying attention to your cravings without trying to avoid them or immediately act on them. It might sound counterintuitive, but by bringing gentle awareness to what you're feeling, you actually reduce its power over you.\n\nPicture this: It's been a long day, and all you want is a cold beer or glass of wine. The craving starts building like a wave gaining strength. Here's how you ride it out:\n\nRecognize what's happening: First, develop awareness of what's going on. Say to yourself, \"Okay, I'm feeling the urge to drink.\" Don't judge yourself or try to push it away. Just notice it. This simple acknowledgment is incredibly powerful.\n\nGet curious about your body: Take a moment to check in physically. What does this urge actually feel like in your body? Maybe you feel restless energy, tension in your chest, or your mouth feels dry. Instead of running from these sensations, get curious about them without judgment.\n\nVisualize the wave: Here's where it gets interesting. Imagine the craving is a literal wave in the ocean. Picture yourself with a surfboard, ready to ride it. The wave gets bigger (this is when the craving feels strongest), but you don't panic. You breathe and stay balanced.\n\nBreathe through it: Keep focusing on your breath as you ride the wave. Remind yourself that waves always pass, they have to. The craving will lose steam, and you'll still be standing strong. No drink required.\n\nReturn to the present: Once the craving starts to subside, gently bring your attention back to the here and now. Look around, take in your surroundings, feel your feet on the ground.\n\nCongratulations, you just successfully surfed a craving. How incredible is that?"

        "description": "You might think ignoring cravings would be the best strategy, but it actually tends to backfire. When you try to suppress or ignore an urge, you're not really dealing with it, you're just stuffing it down.\n\nIt's like trying to hold a beach ball underwater. The harder you push it down, the more pressure builds up, and eventually it's going to pop back up with even more force. This is called the rebound effect, when cravings come back stronger than before.\n\nHere's something interesting about how our brains work: when someone says \"Don't think about a red elephant,\" what immediately comes to mind? Exactly, a red elephant. The same thing happens with urges. Instead of saying \"don't do this,\" it's much more effective to focus on what you can do instead."

Recognizing these patterns helps you prepare for them differently.\n\nPeace of mind: Instead of guilt or regret that might follow giving in to an urge, you feel capable and calm. You've learned the art of emotional regulation.\n\nLasting change: This isn't about short-term wins. By regularly surfing urges, you're rewiring deep-rooted patterns and creating genuine, lasting transformation.\n\nIncreased resilience: The patience and perseverance you develop helps in all areas of life, not just with alcohol."

You're building your own resilience. Each act strengthens your resolve and makes your transformation journey smoother.\n\nThere's something else that happens: your self-perception shifts.

It's celebrating the small victories, like choosing sparkling water over wine, or taking five minutes to breathe when you felt triggered. It's giving yourself credit for the courage it takes to change patterns that have been part of your life for years.\n\nWhen you're kind to yourself, something profound shifts.

The ripple you create will come back to you when you need it most.\n\nListen fully: When someone talks to you today, be completely present. Not thinking about your response, just truly hearing them. It creates connection that no drink ever could.\n\nLeave a note: Write a simple thank you or appreciation note to someone. The act of writing is therapeutic and shifts your focus to gratitude.\n\nGift your time: Help a neighbor, call someone who might be lonely, offer to pick up groceries for a friend.

Positive relationships can dramatically shift how you feel about yourself.

Write these things down. On challenging days, this list becomes your evidence that you're worthy of your own respect.\n\nCare for your body: Move it, nourish it, rest it. This isn't just health advice, it's self-esteem building.

They raise their glasses in a toast, and you're holding your sparkling water, feeling like you're missing some unspoken social requirement. This is classic FOMO (fear of missing out) in action, that nagging feeling that everyone else is having a better time because they're drinking and you're not.\n\nSympathy pressure: Those looks that say \"poor you\" or comments like \"You can't have just one?\" as if your choice is a punishment you're enduring.\n\nRelentless offers: Friends who won't take \"no\" for an answer, who keep suggesting \"just this once\" or \"it's a special occasion.\"\n\nRecognizing these moments is empowering.

Remember the clear mornings, the better sleep, the sense of control you're building. When someone questions your choice, you can simply say, \"I love how I feel without it.\"\n\nFind your ally: If possible, connect with someone else who's not drinking heavily or who supports your choice. Having one person in your corner changes the entire dynamic.\n\nMaster the graceful no: You don't owe anyone an explanation for your choices. \"No thanks, I'm good\" is a complete sentence. If you want to share more, try \"I'm really enjoying my evening without it\" or \"I feel amazing not drinking right now.\"\n\nRedirect the focus: When attention turns to your drink choice, redirect the conversation. \"Tell me about your vacation!\" \"How's your new project going?\" People love talking about themselves more than analyzing your glass.\n\nChange the environment: If the pressure feels too intense, maybe it's the wrong crowd for where you are in your journey. Seek out activities where drinking isn't the main event.\n\nCelebrate your choice: Before you go out, tell your closest friends about your transformation and create a support group around you.

From a neuroscience perspective, habits form through neural pathways that get stronger with repetition, like trails in a forest that become clearer each time someone walks them.\n\nSome habits serve you well, others don't. But here's what's fascinating: your brain doesn't really distinguish between helpful and harmful habits. It just strengthens whatever patterns you repeat most often.\n\nYou might have heard it takes 21 days to form a habit, but that's not quite accurate. Recent research shows it can take anywhere from 18 to 254 days, depending on the complexity of the behavior and the person. What matters isn't the exact timeline, it's understanding how your brain creates these automatic patterns."

Your brain created a three-part cycle: cue (5 PM, stress, celebration), routine (pour a drink), reward (relaxation, dopamine hit).\n\nBut here's the incredible part: you have the power to build new highways.

It wants to keep doing what it's always done because that requires less energy.\n\nThen there's your prefrontal cortex, the part that thinks about long-term consequences and makes conscious decisions. This is where your intention to change lives.\n\nThe problem? Your prefrontal cortex gets tired from making decisions all day. By evening, when you're mentally exhausted, the basal ganglia takes over and defaults to whatever pattern is most familiar, even if it's not what you consciously want.\n\nThis is why willpower alone isn't enough. You need to work with your brain's natural tendencies rather than fight against them.

Maybe it's swapping that first glass of wine for herbal tea, or taking a five-minute walk before settling in for the evening.\n\nKeep the reward: Your brain needs to understand that the new behavior still leads to something good. If alcohol was your way to relax, find other ways to achieve that same sense of calm, whether it's through breathing exercises, a warm bath, or gentle music.\n\nPlan for obstacles: Your old patterns will try to reassert themselves, especially when you're tired, stressed, or in familiar environments. Have a plan ready for these moments.\n\nUse environmental design: Make new behaviors easier and old ones harder. Keep sparkling water visible and wine tucked away. Place your journal where you used to keep glasses.\n\nStack new habits: Attach new behaviors to existing routines. \"After I finish work, I take three deep breaths and check in with how I'm feeling\" can become as automatic as \"After I finish work, I pour a drink\" used to be."

In hypnotherapy, that guard takes a break, allowing access to your unconscious mind where your habits, beliefs, and automatic patterns actually live.\n\nHere's what hypnosis is NOT: blind obedience to someone else, an extreme sleep-like trance, or being unconscious.

This is where your relationship with alcohol was actually formed, through repeated experiences that created unconscious associations.\n\nYour unconscious mind is like the behind-the-scenes crew running the show, influencing decisions you make without consciously realizing it. When it comes to changing your relationship with alcohol, your unconscious can either support your transformation or resist it based on old programming.\n\nHypnotherapy works by updating those unconscious programs.

Maybe you realize you're more likely to crave a drink when you're bored, or that social events trigger you differently than quiet evenings at home.\n\nBy putting pen to paper, you create space between impulse and action. Instead of just reacting to what life brings, you pause and reflect. Often, once you write down what's really bothering you, it becomes easier to breathe and let go.\n\nHere's something crucial to understand: alcohol isn't the problem, it's the solution. It's the solution you found to deal with stress, boredom, celebration, anxiety, or whatever underlying situation was difficult to handle. Through writing, you can start to identify what the real situation or problem is that leads you to reach for alcohol.

Acknowledge your growth and celebrate progress, however small it might seem.\n\nExpand your self-concept: Identify aspects of your identity that feel meaningful and authentic. What roles, interests, values, or qualities define you that have nothing to do with drinking?\n\nChoose your tribe: Surround yourself with people who see your full complexity, not just one facet. Build relationships with those who support your growth and transformation.\n\nUpdate your story: When you catch yourself defining yourself through drinking habits, gently redirect. \"I enjoy good conversations,\" \"I love trying new restaurants,\" \"I'm someone who values authentic connections.\""

While it shields you momentarily from distressing feelings, it can become a cage that prevents growth and authentic change.\n\nConsider this scenario: someone has a glass of wine every night, then two, then a bottle. They tell themselves, \"It's just to unwind. I'm not like other people who drink too much.\" They're not seeing increased consumption as concerning, they're finding ways to make it acceptable.\n\nThis isn't about judgment, it's about understanding how the unconscious mind works to maintain familiar patterns, even when those patterns no longer serve us."

Your mind thinks, \"If I acknowledge this, I'll have to do something about it, and that feels overwhelming.\"\n\nOverwhelm avoidance: Sometimes the path to transformation seems so complex that your brain chooses to ignore the starting point entirely. \"If there's no problem, there's nothing to fix.\"\n\nUnderstanding these protective instincts helps you work with your mind rather than against it."

What are you trying to protect yourself from acknowledging?\n\nRespond instead of react: When someone expresses concern or when you feel defensive, take a breath. What would it look like to respond from awareness rather than reaction?\n\nTake gentle responsibility: Acknowledge your choices without drowning in guilt. \"I chose to drink more than I intended\" is different from \"I'm a terrible person.\"\n\nCreate clear boundaries: Decide what feels healthy for you and stick to those decisions, whether it's continuing alcohol-free or choosing conscious moderation later.\n\nSeek connection: Talk with people who can listen without judgment. Sometimes speaking the truth out loud helps it become more real and manageable.\n\nUse your tools: This is where journaling becomes incredibly valuable.

When you berate yourself for having a craving or struggling with a social situation, you create emotional distress that makes alcohol seem even more appealing as a way to soothe that internal pain.\n\nSelf-compassion, on the other hand, activates your parasympathetic nervous system, the \"rest and repair\" mode where healing and growth can occur naturally."

What was I feeling underneath that urge?\"\n\nPractice the friend test: When you're struggling, ask yourself, \"What would I say to a dear friend going through this exact situation?\" Then offer yourself those same words.\n\nUse your hands: Place your hand on your heart when you're being self-critical. This simple gesture activates your body's self-soothing response and reminds you to treat yourself with care.\n\nWrite yourself a letter: Imagine a friend is facing the same challenges you are. What would you tell them? Write it down, then read it back to yourself.\n\nAcknowledge your humanity: When you make a choice you regret, remind yourself, \"This is what struggling looks like. I'm human, and humans sometimes make decisions that don't align with their goals. This doesn't define me.\"\n\nCelebrate small steps: Notice and acknowledge every positive choice, no matter how small. \"I felt triggered but used a grounding technique instead of reacting\" deserves recognition."

Blood pressure measures the force of that blood against your artery walls, similar to water pressure inside a garden hose.\n\nWhen you get your blood pressure checked, you hear two numbers like 120/80. The larger number (systolic) measures the pressure when your heart actively pumps blood, think of it as the \"push\" phase. The smaller number (diastolic) measures the pressure when your heart rests between beats, the \"pause\" phase.\n\nNormal blood pressure sits around 120/80. When it consistently reads above 130/80, that's hypertension (high blood pressure). Below 90/60 is hypotension (low blood pressure). While both extremes concern healthcare providers, high blood pressure is particularly dangerous because it's linked to heart disease, strokes, and heart attacks.\n\nHere's why they call it \"the silent killer\": high blood pressure rarely has obvious symptoms, so you can have it for years without knowing it's quietly damaging your cardiovascular system."

Women often see increases after menopause due to hormonal changes.\n\nLifestyle factors: The foods you eat, your exercise habits, stress levels, and yes, your alcohol consumption all play significant roles in your blood pressure readings.\n\nMedications: Even over-the-counter medications like decongestants can affect your numbers by constricting blood vessels.\n\nSleep quality: Conditions like sleep apnea can contribute to high blood pressure, which is another reason why the improved sleep you're experiencing matters so much."

Alcohol might knock you out initially, but it prevents the deep, restorative sleep your brain and body actually need.\n\nNatural energy: Without spending energy recovering from alcohol's effects, you have more available for everything else. It's not endless energy, but it's steady and real rather than the artificial boost that comes from caffeine trying to counteract alcohol's aftermath.\n\nMental clarity: Your thinking is probably sharper. Decision-making feels easier. That foggy feeling that you might not have realized was there is lifting.\n\nPhysical comfort: Your skin looks better because you're properly hydrated. Your digestion works more smoothly without alcohol irritating your stomach lining. Your body temperature regulates more naturally.\n\nEmotional stability: Alcohol disrupts the balance of neurotransmitters that regulate mood. Without that chemical interference, your emotional baseline is probably feeling more stable and manageable."

Why sit with difficult emotions when you could chemically alter them immediately? Why work through stress when you could numb it?\n\nThese weren't moral failures.
